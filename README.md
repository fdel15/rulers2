# Rulers2

A Ruby MVC framework built from the ground up. The purpose of this project was to understand the Rails framework better. This framework is designed to work a lot like rails, but much simpler. 

Thank you to Noah Gibbs for writing the great book [Rebuilding Rails](http://rebuilding-rails.com/RebuildingRailsFree.pdf)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'rulers2'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rulers2

## Usage

I have used this framework to build a very simple app you can find [here](https://github.com/fdel15/best_quotes).
